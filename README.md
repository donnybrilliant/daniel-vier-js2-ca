CA Social Media is a course assignment for the subject JavaScript 2 at Noroff.

## Description

The goal of this assignment is to apply knowledge of JavaScript techniques to implement the front-end functionality for a social media application.

## Built With

- Bootstrap
- SASS
- Live Server
- Vanilla Javascript
- Noroff Social Media API

## Site Architecture

- Login page
- Feed
- Profile page

## Brief

You have been tasked with producing a new JavaScript front-end client for an existing social media platform. The client application must be attractive and responsive, but you have an otherwise blank slate in terms of theme design language.

Using the provided API and API documentation, create a functioning user interface that allows for viewing, posting, editing and deleting social media content.

Social API routes require authorisation via JWT (JSON Web Tokens). You will need to register an account and login to access your token.

To complete the required features, you will also need to make use of GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE HTTP methods.

Using localStorage is highly recommended, especially for storing JWT tokens.

A finished project fulfils the requirements below with an easy to use and error-free user interface.

## Required features

The following user stories are required for a passing submission:

- User with @noroff.no or @stud.noroff.no email can register profile
- Registered user can login
- User can view a post content feed
- User can filter the post content feed
- User can search the post content feed
- User can view a post content item by ID
- User can create a post content item
- User can update a post content item
- User can delete a post content item
